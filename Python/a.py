# Create a program with a for loop and a continue statement. 
# The program should 
#   iterate over a string of digits, 
#   replace each 0 with x, and 
#   print the modified string to the screen. 
# Use the skeleton below:

for digit in "0165031806510":
    if digit == "0":
        print("x", end="")
        continue
    print(digit, end="")
